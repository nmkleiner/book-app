        <h3>This app was built using the VUE framework.
        It renders a list of books, with titles and cover images from a server, 
            and allows the user to click a book to go to the book details, read a full description,
            read reviews, add / remove reviews.
            The app is responsive, looks and behaves good both in mobile and in desktop.</h3>
